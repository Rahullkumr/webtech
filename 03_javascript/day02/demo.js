// FEATURES OF JAVASCRIPT

// 1. Single threaded (doctor, nurse example)
// 2. synchronous 
// 3. object oriented (since we can create our own objects) and object based (everything is object in js)
// 4. Interpreted (JS doesn't know how many lines of code are there at first; kyuki compiler hai hi nahi)
// 5. Dynamically typed (can change value of a variable at runtime)
// 6. Loosely typed (; is not mandatory and others)

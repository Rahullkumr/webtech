    <!-- 
        What is DOM(Document Object Model)?

            suppose we have to modify(change content or the styling) one or multiple elements of a html file by using JS, we use DOM.

            - DOM is a collection of APIs[application programming interface] (webapi) which is used to connect JavaScript with HTML, and makes it possible to change the webpageâ€™s content, style, or behavior dynamically without reloading the page, by just using JS.

            - Each HTML tag becomes an object (node) in the DOM tree. 
            
            - For example, <h1> is a node in the DOM tree, then we can modify its text, change its color, or even remove it entirely using JavaScript.

    - em      ==> take reference from parent element
    - rem     ==> take reference from root element

1. 1em(element) = 1 times of parent

    if parent is html, then 1em = 16px (since every tag's default font is 16px except heading tags)

2. 2rem(root element) = 2 times of root element

    always takes reference from root element i.e "html" tag
